<?php 

    //  use it like this get_template_part( 'partials/department', 'button' ); 
    //  the service part is the first section of the partial file
    //  and the button bit is the second half
    

?>

THIS WILL NEED THE QUERY CODE INSIDE IT BUT INSTEAD OF WELLS IT WILL BE INSIDE A BUTTON AND EACH POST WILL BE A LIST ITEM IN A BUTTON
